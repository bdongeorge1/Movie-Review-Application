# Movie-Review-Application
This project is a Movie API built using Spring Boot and MongoDB. It allows users to fetch and manage movie-related data, including titles, genres, release dates, and trailers. The API interacts with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve movie details and uses external data sources like the TMDb API for movie information and media assets.
